1. Data Access:
   - Extensions can request permission to read/change all website data.

2. Malicious Behaviour:
   - Some extensions may track keystrokes, steal credentials, or hijack sessions.

3. Fake Publishers:
   - Unverified or third-party publishers can inject harmful scripts.

4. Hidden Code:
   - Malicious code can be obfuscated and activated after installation.

5. Poor Ratings/Reviews:
   - User reviews are red flags. Malware extensions often have low ratings and virus reports.

6. Broad Permissions:
   - Dangerous ones often ask for access to all URLs, file access, and incognito mode.

7. Bypassing Googleâ€™s Review:
   - Not all extensions are thoroughly reviewed by the Chrome Web Store. Manual checking is crucial.

ðŸ§  **Pro Tip:** 
Always review extension permissions and source before installing. Stick to official or well-known publishers.
